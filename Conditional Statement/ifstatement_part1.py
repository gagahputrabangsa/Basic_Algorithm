#if statement is like when some condition is met, then the rest of the code inside it will be executed

name = input("Please Enter Your Name: ") #var
#place the conditional statement here
if name == 'gaga': 
  print("Welcome Master ><") #so, if I entered 'gaga' as my name, it will printout Welcome Gaga ><
#now if the name is other than gaga:
print("Who Are You?")
